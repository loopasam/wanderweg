While the coastal "Sentieri Azzuri", or blue trails, from town to town in the Cinque Terre are beautiful, they were a bit too packed with tourists for our taste! Fortunately, we found the mountain trails to be much quieter and just as lovely. This hike started with an intense uphill climb out of Corniglia, passsing behind the main church into terraced vineyards and finally up into a hillside forest. We were amazed at how abruptly and completely the vegetation changed as we climbed, from semi-arid scrub and flowers to a humid forest thick with ferns. Once we emerged onto the mountain ridge that runs behind and parallel to the coast, we found ourselved in a much more open, light woodland, with wildflowers carpeting the ground beneath the trees. The temperature on the ridge was also much cooler, we discovered, with a refreshing though somewhat chilly breeze.

We traversed the ridge for a while, enjoying a view down to the sea on the right and into the next valley over on the left. For a lunch break, we stopped at the Menhir, which I was expecting to be an archaeological site but which turned out to be large-ish rock with the word "Menhir" written on it. At least it made a nice bench! Shortly thereafter, the trail descended quite steeply until reaching a main road. At this point, we had the choice to aim back northwards and end in Manarola, or continue southwards to Riomaggiore. We took the second route, continuing our descent through pine trees and an expanse of flowering yellow bushes (yet another change in vegetation) and down some very steep steps. We entered Riomaggiore from the top and made our way down to the harbor and a gelato shop selling refreshing lemon granitas.  All in all a challenging but rewarding hike.
