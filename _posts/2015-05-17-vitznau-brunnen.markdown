From Vitznau, the Vierwaldstaetterweg climbs up and over a small peninsula to the south. Crossing again into the canton of Schwyz, hikers are rewarded with some beautiful views of the opposite side of the lake and snow-dusted mountains in the distance. The trail continues to skirt above the lakeshore until it reaches the town of Gersau, where it descends through the town along a central boulevard until it reaches the waterfront. Several restaurants and cafes are can be found along the water in Gersau, in case some refreshments are in order! 

Continuing east, the trail ascends again, staying mostly in quiet, forested areas. The final stretch into Brunnen, while mostly flat, is one of the less pleasant parts of the hike, since it involves walking along the edge of the main road beside the lake while cars and motorcycles zoom past. For those with aching feet at the end of the hike, Brunnen has a very nice public beach, where one can use the facilities, buy an ice cream to enjoy along with the view, or simply take a dip in the chilly water.
