This section of the Vierwaldstaetterweg starts gently, leaving Kuessnacht to the east and following the lakeshore south through numerous cherry orchards and the small town of Greppen. A highlight is the self-service organic farm shop at the top of hillside, where visitors can sample homemade apple cider while enjoying a view of the lake and the resident alpacas! After following an exercise circuit through the forest, the trail begins to ascend and passes over Weggis, where beautiful views of lake and mountains can be found.

You might think that the uphill section ends when you move from a small paved road up the mountain to a winding trail along the hollows, but be warned: the path is labeled "Bergwanderweg" for a reason! In order to reach Vitznau, hikers must pass over a steep, rocky ridge, which requires climbing a series of steep metal staircases set into the cliffs as well as navigating a rather uneven, narrow trail up the mountain. Finally, after arriving at the top, an equally steep descent past curious cows and precarious-looking driveways leads you down into Vitznau. A cold beer on the lakefront and a dip of tired feet in the water are deserved rewards. For those still motivated to see some more alpine views, a trip on the Rigi-Bahn cog railway is highly recommended!
