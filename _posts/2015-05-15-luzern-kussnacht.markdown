Starting from the center of Luzern, the trail follows the northern edge of the Vierwaldstaettersee. After passing through the Verkehrshaus Lido and a few back gardens, it begins to gradually wind its way upwards and away from the lake, starting with a short climb to the impressive Schloss Meggenhorn. The town of Meggen itself is also rather impressive, being home to a surprising density of new and expensive-looking houses (though some are of questionable taste!). 

Leaving manmade luxury behind, the trail then ascends in earnest, entering a stretch of forest as the same time as it crosses from the canton of Luzern to the canton of Schwyz. It skirts in a semicircle around a picturesque lake before starting a gentle descent into Kuessnacht, weaving through farmland and trees. A pleasant and not-too-difficult walk, although the weather can be quite variable even in mid-May, which we learned the hard way!
