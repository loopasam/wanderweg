Embolded by the success of our Corniglia - Riomaggiore hike, we decided to try another mountain trail, this time starting in the more northerly town of Vernazza. As before, the trail started with an ascent, though somewhat more gradual this time. We quickly realized that the path actually doubled as a meditative walk up to a chapel in the hills, with the "Stations of the Cross" (small scenes depicting the life and death of Christ) posted along the way. The church itself was rather unusual, both in its situation on a beautiful grassy overlook with a view down to the sea, complete with a small cafe and picnic tables, and the addition of bright electric lightbulbs to the main cross inside, which gave it an air reminiscent of a Broadway stage!

After leaving the church behind, we again continued up until reaching the ridge that runs behind the five towns of the Cinque Terre. We were excited to reach Malpertuso, which was marked as the highest point in the area on the map, although once there we realized that the trail did not actually go all the way to the summit. Still, we again enjoyed a nice, elevated lunch spot with a beautiful view through the trees to the sea. The end of this trail, as it descended towards Corniglia, overlapped with the beginning of the previous hike we had taken. We appreciated the opportunity to go down through the vineyards, even as we tried to encourage others who passed us on the way up the steep climb. Although the hike was slightly longer than the one from Corniglia to Riomaggiore, we found it somewhat less strenuous and highly enjoyable.
